# Magadh University Result Page Clone

This repository is a **fun project** designed to mimic the result page of **Magadh University, Bodh Gaya**. It was created purely for entertainment purposes as an **April Fool's Day prank (1st April)**.

## Purpose
This project is meant to provide a **static mock-up** of a university result page, allowing users to enter their **Registration Number** and **Exam Roll Number** to generate a (fake) marksheet.

## Disclaimer
- This website is **not affiliated** with Magadh University.
- The marksheet generated is **not real** and should not be used for official purposes.
- It is meant **only for fun and pranks**.

## How It Works
1. Enter a **Registration Number** and **Exam Roll Number**.
2. Click on **Show Marksheet**.
3. A static PDF file will open, displaying a fake marksheet.

## Tech Stack Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** (Bootstrap) for styling
- **JavaScript** for simple interactivity

## Enjoy the Prank! ðŸŽ­
Feel free to use this for fun, but rememberâ€”itâ€™s all just a joke! ðŸ˜†
